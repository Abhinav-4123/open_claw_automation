# Cold Email Sequences

## Sequence 1: The Bug Finder

### Email 1 (Day 0)
**Subject:** Found something on [Company]

```
Hi [First Name],

I'm building an AI that tests web apps automatically. Ran it on [their-site.com] today.

[If found issue]: Found an issue with your [specific flow] - [brief description].

[If no issue]: Good news - your [checkout/login] flow is working perfectly.

Want me to send the full report? I can also set up daily monitoring for free.

[Your Name]
```

### Email 2 (Day 3)
**Subject:** Re: Found something on [Company]

```
Hi [First Name],

Just following up on my last email.

Quick context: I'm offering free QA monitoring to 10 beta users. You'd get:

- Daily smoke tests at 6 AM
- Slack alerts when something breaks
- Screenshots of every step

No code changes, no SDK. Takes 5 min to set up.

Interested?

[Your Name]
```

### Email 3 (Day 7)
**Subject:** Last chance - beta spots closing

```
Hi [First Name],

Final follow-up on this.

We're closing beta spots tomorrow. If you want free QA monitoring for [their-site.com], reply "yes" and I'll set it up today.

Either way, no hard feelings. Good luck with [Company]!

[Your Name]

## Sequence 2: The Pain Point Approach

### Email 1 (Day 0)
**Subject:** How do you catch production bugs?

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: how does your team know when signup or checkout breaks?

Most teams find out from angry users or support tickets. By then, you've lost revenue.

I built an AI that tests your critical flows every morning and alerts Slack instantly if anything fails.

Would a free trial be useful?

### Email 2 (Day 4)
**Subject:** Re: How do you catch production bugs?

```
Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share what [Similar Company] experienced:

- Day 1: Set up monitoring in 5 minutes
- Day 3: Caught a broken checkout button (CSS bug from deploy)
- Day 3: Fixed before users noticed

They're now a paying customer.

Want to try it free for a week?

## Sequence 3: The Social Proof Play

### Email 1 (Day 0)
**Subject:** [Similar Company] uses this for QA

```
Hi [First Name],

[Similar Company] just started using our AI QA tool.

Within 48 hours, it caught a payment flow bug that would've cost them ~$10k in lost transactions.

We run automated tests on:
✓ Signup
✓ Login
✓ Checkout
✓ Any custom flow

Slack alert + screenshot when anything breaks.

Can I set up a free trial for [Company]?
