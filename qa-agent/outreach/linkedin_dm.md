## Template 1: Direct Value Offer (Best Performer)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company] QA

**Message:**
```
Hey [First Name],

I built an AI that tests login/checkout flows every morning and alerts you the moment something breaks.

I just ran it on [their-site.com] - [specific finding or "your checkout flow looks solid"].

Looking for 3 beta partners to run this free for a week. Interested?

## Template 2: Pain Point Opener

**Message:**
```
Hey [First Name],

Quick question - how does your team catch it when signup or checkout breaks in production?

I ask because I'm working on an AI agent that runs smoke tests every morning at 6 AM and pings Slack if anything's broken.

Would you be open to a free trial? Takes 5 min to set up.

## Template 3: Social Proof

**Message:**
```
Hey [First Name],

[Similar Company] just started using our AI QA agent - it caught a broken payment flow within 2 hours of deployment.

We monitor login, signup, and checkout 24/7 and send instant Slack alerts with screenshots.

Want me to set up a free week for [Company]?
```

## Template 4: Founder-to-Founder

**Message:**
```
Hey [First Name],

Fellow founder here. Built something I think you'd find useful.

It's an AI that tests your app's critical flows daily and alerts you before users complain.

No SDK, no code changes. Just give us a URL.

Can I run a free test on [their-site.com]?
```

## Template 5: After Finding a Real Issue

**Message:**
```
Hey [First Name],

I was testing my QA automation tool and ran it against [their-site.com].

Found something you might want to look at: [specific issue - e.g., "the 'Forgot Password' link returns a 404" or "checkout fails on mobile viewport"].

Happy to share the full report if helpful. Also happy to run daily tests for free for a week.

## Cold Email Template

**Subject:** Caught a bug on [Company] - free QA report

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I'm building TestGuard, an AI that runs daily smoke tests on SaaS apps.

I tested [their-site.com] this morning and [found X / everything looked good].

We monitor:
- Signup flow
- Login flow
- Checkout/payment
- Any custom flow you need

When something breaks, you get a Slack alert with screenshots within minutes.

Would you like a free week of monitoring? No code changes needed.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's what our reports look like: [link to sample report]

## Target Companies

**Ideal Customer Profile:**
- SaaS companies ($1M - $50M ARR)
- E-commerce sites with checkout flows
- Fintech apps (high compliance needs)
- Healthtech (HIPAA compliance screenshots)

**Where to Find Them:**
1. **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** - Filter: Founder/CTO, SaaS, 11-200 employees
2. **Twitter/X** - Search: "launched" OR "shipped" OR "just deployed"
3. **Product Hunt** - New launches need QA badly
4. **YC Company Directory** - Batch companies, Series A-B
5. **Crunchbase** - Recently funded startups

**Volume:**
- Send 20 DMs/day on LinkedIn
- Send 20 DMs/day on Twitter
- Send 50 cold emails/day

**Expected Results:**
- 10-15% response rate
- 3-5% convert to trial
- 30% trial-to-paid conversion

**Math to $1M MRR:**
- 667 paying customers at $1,500/mo = $1M MRR
- At 1.5% cold-to-paid rate, need ~45,000 outreach touches
- At 100 touches/day = 450 days = 15 months
- With referrals + inbound, realistically 8-12 months
